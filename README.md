# Text-Classification-using-random-forest-classifier
The objective of this project is to scrape consumer reviews from a set of web pages and to evaluate the performance of text classification algorithms on the data.

I have scraped a website using beautifulSoup and extracted customer reviews and assigned postive/negtive reviews to them

Performed Text Preprocessing and generated the TF-IDF of the words

Used RandomForest Classifier to train and test the model
